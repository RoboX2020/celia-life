Prompt: View Modes for Patient & Doctor UI

Add a global view mode switcher to the MedVault interface so that the same underlying medical documents can be visualized in three different ways:
  1.  By date (Timeline / Visits)
  2.  By document category (current behavior: lab reports, medical images, doctor notes, prescriptions, etc.)
  3.  By clinical type (dermatology, cardiology, dentistry, neurology, etc.)

Global behavior
  •  The existing layout stays:
  •  Left sidebar with “Document types” (or equivalent)
  •  Main content area with upload panel and document list.
  •  Above the document list (near the top of the main content area), add a “View as:” switcher – for example a 3-tab control or segmented buttons:
  •  By date
  •  By category
  •  By clinical type
  •  Switching between these modes does not change the underlying data; it only changes how the documents and visits are grouped and displayed.
  •  Any newly uploaded document should automatically appear in all three views, just grouped differently.

1. View as: By date (Timeline / Visits)

Goal: Show the patient’s history as a sequence of visits/episodes in time, so that doctors can see what happened around the same period and how different doctors and tests relate to one issue.

UI behavior:
  •  When “By date” is selected in the view switcher:
  •  The main content area changes from a flat list of individual documents to a timeline of visits/episodes.
  •  Each visit/episode card represents a cluster of documents that happened within a similar time window (e.g. same day or same week) and are logically connected.
  •  Card header: date (or date range), e.g. “3–7 May 2025”.
  •  Sub-header: short label like “Migraine workup”, “Abdominal pain – ER visit”, “Dermatology follow-up” (generated later by AI; for now this can be a placeholder).
  •  Inside the card: mini list of documents associated with that visit:
  •  document type badge (Lab report, Doctor note, Medical image, Prescription, etc.)
  •  short title
  •  The cards are ordered chronologically from newest to oldest (or allow a toggle).
  •  Clicking a document inside a visit card opens the same document detail view as in other modes.
  •  Optional controls:
  •  A small date range filter (e.g. last 6 months / last 12 months / all time).
  •  A simple free-text search that filters visits where any document matches.

From the doctor’s perspective, this lets them quickly answer:

“What was happening around March 2024?” and “What did the patient try at the same time for this issue?”

2. View as: By category (current behavior, but explicit)

Goal: Show documents grouped by file/document category (lab reports, medical images, doctor notes, prescriptions, other).

UI behavior:
  •  When “By category” is selected:
  •  The UI should behave very similarly to the current MedVault demo.
  •  The left sidebar remains a list of document categories:
  •  All documents
  •  Lab reports
  •  Medical images
  •  Doctor notes
  •  Prescriptions
  •  Other
  •  The main document list shows individual documents filtered by the selected category:
  •  card/row with title, document type badge, file name, size, upload date.
  •  Upload panel at the top behaves the same: when files are uploaded, they appear in this list in the correct category.

This is the “raw documents” view for both patient and doctor.

⸻

3. View as: By clinical type (specialty / body system / problem type)

Goal: Group all data by clinical area / specialty / problem type, so both patient and doctor can see everything related to “Dermatology”, “Cardiology”, “Stomatology (dentistry)”, etc.
